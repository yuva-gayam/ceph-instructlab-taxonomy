      The crash module collects information about daemon crashdumps and stores it in the Ceph cluster for analysis.
      Enabling the module requires running:
      ceph mgr module enable crash
      Additionally, create an upload key with:
      ceph auth get-or-create client.crash mon 'profile crash' mgr 'profile crash'

      - question: |
          What is the purpose of the crash module in Ceph?
        answer: |
          The crash module collects daemon crashdumps and stores them in the Ceph cluster for analysis.
      - question: |
          How do you enable the crash module in Ceph?
        answer: |
          Enable it by running: ceph mgr module enable crash.
      - question: |
          How is the crash upload key generated?
        answer: |
          Use the command: ceph auth get-or-create client.crash mon 'profile crash' mgr 'profile crash'.
