      ## Testing

      The current usage testing does the following:

      Following these operations:

      > -   Create a few buckets
      > -   Remove buckets
      > -   Create a bucket
      > -   Put object
      > -   Remove object

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What operations are tested in the usage testing?
        answer: |
          The operations include creating/removing buckets and objects.
      - question: |
          What is verified during the usage testing process?
        answer: |
          The tests verify that usage show commands and entries are correct.
      - question: |
          How many operations are mentioned in the testing procedure?
        answer: |
          Five operations: create/remove buckets, create/remove objects.

      Test:

      1.  Verify that 'usage show' with delete_obj category isn't empty after no more than 45 seconds (wait to flush).
      2.  Check the following

      > -   'usage show'
      >     -   does not error out
      >     -   num of entries > 0
      >     -   num of summary entries > 0
      >     -   for every entry in categories check successful_ops > 0
      >     -   check that correct uid in the user summary
      > -   'usage show' with specified uid (--uid=<uid>)
      >     -   num of entries > 0
      >     -   num of summary entries > 0
      >     -   for every entry in categories check successful_ops > 0
      >     -   check that correct uid in the user summary
      > -   'usage show' with specified uid and specified categories (create_bucket, put_obj, delete_obj, delete_bucket)
      >     -   for each category:
      >         -   does not error out
      >         -   num of entries > 0
      >         -   user in user summary is correct user
      >         -   length of categories entries under user summary is exactly 1
      >         -   name of category under user summary is correct name
      >         -   successful ops for the category > 0
      > -   'usage trim' with specified uid
      >     -   does not error
      >     -   check following 'usage show' shows complete usage info cleared for user

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What should be verified for the 'usage show' with delete_obj category?
        answer: |
          It should not be empty after 45 seconds and flush.
      - question: |
          What should be checked for each 'usage show'?
        answer: |
          Ensure no errors, non-zero entries, successful operations, and correct uid.
      - question: |
          What happens during 'usage show' for a specific uid and category?
        answer: |
          Ensure no errors, valid entries, correct user in summary, and successful ops.

      Additional required testing:

      > -   test multiple users
      >     Do the same as in (2), with multiple users being set up.
      > -   test with multiple buckets (> 1000 * factor, e.g., 2000)
      >     Create multiple buckets, put objects in each. Account the number
      >     written data and verify that usage reports show the expected number (up to a certain delta).
      > -   verify usage show with a date/time range
      >     Take timestamp of the beginning of the test, and the end of the
      >     test. Round timestamps to the nearest hour (downward from start of
      >     test, upward from the end of test). List data starting at
      >     end-time, make sure that no data is being shown. List data
      >     ending at start-time, make sure that no data is shown. List data
      >     beginning at start-time, make sure that correct data is displayed.
      >     List data ending end end-time, make sure that correct data is
      >     displayed. List data beginning in begin-time, ending in end-time,
      >     make sure that correct data is displayed.

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is tested with multiple users?
        answer: |
          The same checks from the previous section are done with multiple users.
      - question: |
          How is the test done with multiple buckets?
        answer: |
          Create more buckets, put objects, and verify data matches usage reports.
      - question: |
          What is verified during usage show with date/time range?
        answer: |
          Ensure no data outside the range and correct data within the range.

      >     Trim data beginning in begin-time, ending in end-time, make sure
      >     that all data has been trimmed.

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What should be checked when verifying usage trim with a date/time range?
        answer: |
          Ensure no data is trimmed outside the range and all data within is trimmed.
      - question: |
          What should happen when trimming data starting at the end-time?
        answer: |
          No data should be trimmed if it starts at the end-time.
      - question: |
          What happens when trimming data in the specified date/time range?
        answer: |
          All data within the range should be correctly trimmed.

      ## Summary

      Testing includes verifying basic usage operations, such as creating/removing buckets and objects.
      Additional checks include verifying usage shows no errors and correctly counting successful operations.
      Further testing involves verifying functionality with multiple users, large numbers of buckets,
      and specific date/time ranges.
      The system should accurately reflect usage and handle trimming operations within specified time ranges.

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the main purpose of the usage testing?
        answer: |
          To verify correct operation of usage reporting for various scenarios.
      - question: |
          How is usage verified for multiple users?
        answer: |
          The same checks are performed for each user with the correct summary.
      - question: |
          What is tested regarding usage with date/time ranges?
        answer: |
          The correct data is displayed based on start and end time ranges.
